            <p>When people get interested in trading, there is usually only one reason behind it: money. And there is nothing wrong with it. Trading is a great opportunity to generate an income where you are not paid by the hour and you can even set up your trading in a way that it generates a more passive income stream where you make some money on the side.</p>
<p>This is all good and being motivated by money can be a great driver. However, this can quickly change into the contrary when a trader approaches his monetary goals from a wrong perspective. In this article we want to highlight some research findings that show that when people view money in the wrong context it can actually harm their trading and, then, we want to help you adopt a healthier relationship with it to set yourself up for success.</p>
<p> <img src="http://www.tradeciety.com/wp-content/uploads/pyramid-1.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>If you need money, you won’t get it – research confirmed<br>When it comes to being driven by money, there are usually two things that happen when a trader has a wrong perception:</p>
<p>#1 Unrealistic expectations</p>
<p>We are all guilty of that to some degree: when starting out as new traders, we projected that it would only take a few years to turn a few hundred or thousand Dollars into a huge pile of cash and quit our day jobs. Having unrealistic goals quickly leads to frustration when those expectations aren’t met. The quitting rate for new traders is astronomical (40% quit within 1 month) and one of the main reasons are probably wrong ideas and expectations.</p>
<p>pyramid<br>Source and references here</p>
<p>Once a trader sees that trading isn’t going to be the easy and fast way out, there are usually three things that happen: he either quits, he takes a riskier approach to trading (larger positions, more trades, gambling mentality), or he starts system-hopping if he still believes that there must be a trading method out there that can generate those returns.</p>
<p>Investors with a large differential between their existing economic conditions and their aspiration levels hold riskier stocks in their portfolios.<br>– Kumar: Who Gambles In The Stock Market? – Accessed through: econ.yale.edu</p>
<p>#2 The need to trade</p>
<p>High expectations, as we said, can lead to taking more trades and increasing risk to meet return goals. As we will see shortly, setting yourself goals for X amount of money is the surest way to trading failure.</p>
<p>Especially traders with small accounts struggle with that because they soon realize that a small account will not get them to where they want to be. Although you can read that trading a small account is no different, it’s just not true. Trading with less capital is definitely harder – much harder. With a small trading account, your wins are often close to meaningless which then creates the need to trade more and introduce more risk in your trading.</p>
<p>High net worth investors are likely to have lower turnover.<br>– Anderson, Stranaham: Account Turnover and Demographic Profiles: Which Investors Trade Too Much? – Accessed through: Bradley.edu</p>
<p>What not do when it comes to trading goals<br>When it comes to setting goals, there are a few don’ts and I will explain why you have to avoid them at all costs if you want to become a better trader.</p>
<p>#1 Daily/weekly return goals</p>
<p>I see so many traders say that they want to generate 3%, 4% or 5% per week because they have calculated that this will help them achieve their goals in a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>Monetary goals are the worst of all because it creates the need to trade and it puts the traders in a constant state of hunting for signals. 99% of the time, such traders will never meet their goals and they end up losing money because they take mediocre trades, hoping to realize their target.</p>
<p>You can’t control how much you can take out of the market. The only thing you can control is the risk of your trade and the types of trades you take. The outcome is not in your hands. Some weeks, you will get more and better trades and sometimes you just have to sit it out. You have to eliminate the need to trade as much as you can.</p>
<p>#2 Capturing x points per week</p>
<p>Go to any trading forum and you’ll see people looking for methods that give them 20 pips per day or 100 pips per week. Again, those traders tackle the problem from the wrong side and measuring performance in pips is meaningless because you neglect the risk-aspect of your trades.</p>
<p>Traders who set themselves points/pips related goals are more likely to close winning trades too early when they hit their goal and rob themselves from making larger gains. Or, they desperately try to ride trades too long and then end up with nothing. Always stay open-minded and take what is available.</p>
<p>Characteristics of good goals<br>When it comes to goal-setting, whether it’s trading related or in your regular life, you have to set goals that can be achieved through your own actions. Often, people set goals that they have no control over and then they are frustrated when they don’t reach them.</p>
<p>This becomes obvious when we come back to our two anti-examples. Setting yourself the goal of achieving a certain amount of %-return is not going to work because you have no control over it and no matter how hard you try, your actions don’t control the outcome. You can’t control if the market gives you enough signals, if the signals lead into profitable trades and how long you can ride your trades.</p>
<p>The graphic below compares the things that we as traders can’t control and the things we can control in our trading. At first glance it is obvious that 90% of all traders focus exclusively on the left side and they try to control the uncontrollable. They are even often completely blind to the fact that as traders we have so much things we can influence and then see themselves as victims.</p>
<p>control<br><img src="http://www.tradeciety.com/wp-content/uploads/control-1.png" alt="image"><br>By the way, there is a great non-trading related TED talk about setting goals, being your own coach and think in terms of the process: Building your inner coach by Brett Ledbetter</p>
<p>The right goals<br>Now let’s explore how goal setting is really done in trading and what you should be focusing on if you want to become a better trader. Here are 4 things that will almost guarantee trading success:</p>
<p>#1 Execution</p>
<p>This is also the so-called process-oriented mindset where you detach yourself from the outcome of a trade and only focus on making the best trades possible and follow your rules as closely as possible. It sounds cliché, but it’s the so important if you want to improve as a trader.</p>
<p>Even with a good system, you will often have losing trades and there is nothing wrong with that. You only have to control your reaction to those losses. Thus, you should accept that as long as you follow your rules, you have done your job as a trader and that it’s not your job to force trades into winners.</p>
<p>#2 Routine</p>
<p>Many (or most) losing traders don’t follow a routine and their trading is all over the place. A good routine will help improve your trading A LOT because it adds structure and a new level of professionalism. I love and honor my routine and it gives me structure and certainty. I know that as long as I follow my routine and do my work, I have done everything I was supposed to do.</p>
<p>My edge is directly related to the quality of the work I put into my trading.</p>
<p>Process-oriented</p>
<p><img src="http://www.tradeciety.com/wp-content/uploads/Process-oriented.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>#3 Habits to form a routine</p>
<p>当一切成为习惯，就没有你想做和不想做，任何事都没有感情</p>
<p>This ties in with the previous point. We have all heard the quote below so many times that it has lost its meaning, but it so true. A professional trader is a structured and organized trader who has adopted good and helpful habits.</p>
<p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. Aristotle</p>
<p>Here are some of my personal habits that I connect with successful trading:</p>
<p>一些推荐的交易习惯：</p>
<p>1.每周末复盘</p>
<p>2.在纸上，写下自己的下单策略，一条一条比对，满足后再下单。</p>
<p>3.记下每一笔交易</p>
<p>4.周末分析交易中存在的缺点，分析交易行为</p>
<p>Setting a few hours aside every Sunday to recap my last trading week and create extensive trading plans for the upcoming week.<br>Using a physical checklist before entering trades to make sure I avoid unnecessary mistakes.<br>Journaling all my trades after I have taken them.<br>Performing a detailed performance review each Saturday and going over all my past trades once again to find weaknesses and analyze trading behavior.</p>
<p>You can see, there is no secret or something earthshattering new here. Successful trading is the sum of repeating good habits that form your routine.</p>
<p>A personal tip: create an environment where you enjoy the process. Each Sunday, I start with a gym workout, I go for a swim and have a good breakfast at my favorite restaurant. Then, I head to my favorite coffee shop and do my Sunday prep for the next 4/5 hours while enjoying amazing coffee, nice company and some good music. I wouldn’t miss this routine for the world and for me this does not have anything to do with work.</p>
<p>#4 Recognize and focus on progress</p>
<p>关注过程是非常非常重要的，对于那些新手和小账户操作者，因为小账户的微小结果并不能对交易产生积极的影响。如果，帐户的盈利没有达到你的期望，你就会感到非常的消极和沮丧。然而，时刻提醒自己，你从哪里开始，到哪里去，已经有了多少进展。这些，会让你感到在1-2年内成功是非常困难的，然而随着每天的持续的进步，成功是必然而不是偶然。</p>
<p>This is especially important for new traders or people who trade with small trading accounts. It’s very easy to get demotivated and frustrated if you are not seeing the level of success you were hoping for. However, to make sure that you are growing, focus on how far you have come already. Remind yourself of where you are coming from and how you started and how much progress you have made already. It’s unrealistic to believe that you can become a professional trader within 1 or 2 years, but by making constant improvements week after week, succeeding is not an accident but it’s plannable.</p>
<p>“You don’t try to build a wall. You don’t set out to build a wall. You don’t say ‘I’m going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that’s ever been built.’ You don’t start there. You say ‘I’m gonna lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid,’ and you do that every single day, and soon you have a wall.” – Will Smith</p>
<p>成功是一步一步积累起来的，交易上的成功也是。随着每一天对策略的完善，对心态的打磨，日积月累，才能成功。</p>
<p>最后我想说，一切道理都明白，但是一到实盘全玩完，也是白搭啊！！！<br>执行力，淡定，才是王道。</p>

            <h1 id="RSI指标"><a href="#RSI指标" class="headerlink" title="RSI指标"></a>RSI指标</h1><p><em>这个 指标是我（译者）非常喜欢的一个，基本上，我也只使用这一种指标。因为他看起来清晰明了，不会使交易者分神在复杂的图表上。并且他直观的说明了当前走势（k线）的强／弱势。在震荡，趋势市场中都有他的用法，通过下面介绍的几种方法，可以从不同角度观察市场形势，从而做出赢率更大的判断。</em></p>
<p><code>code xxx</code></p>
<p>相对强弱指数（RSI），是一个被广泛使用的的指标。正如其名，通过RSI指标可以直观的看出价格的强弱关系。本文中会首先介绍RSI的计算过程，从而能看到这个指标所表现的市场哪一方面，最后会介绍RSI的使用方法。</p>
<p>The introduction – Understanding the RSI</p>
<h2 id="介绍RSI"><a href="#介绍RSI" class="headerlink" title="介绍RSI"></a>介绍RSI</h2><p>使用RSI的时候，只有一个默认值是14的配置项，这个配置，会使用之前14个K线（时间周期）的价格来计算RSI的值。</p>
<p>从计算公式来看，RSI衡量的过去14个周期中，阴线数量，阳线数量，以及他们幅度之间的关系。假如，过去的14根K线都是阳线，那么RSI值就是100，反之如果之前14根K线都是阴线，那么RSI就是0.如果RSI值等于50，说明过去有7根阳线7根阴线，并且7根阴线的涨幅等于7根阴线的跌幅。</p>
<p>举几个例子说明一下RSI是如何计算的。</p>
<p>下图高亮部分，14根K中有13个阳线和1个阴线。最终计算出的RSI值是85</p>
<p><img src="http://forex-blog.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/RSI_1.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>下图计算了3个高亮区域的RSI值</p>
<p>RSI1<br><img src="http://forex-blog.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/RSI_2.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>第一部分，有9根阴线，4个小阳，和一个十字星，RSI值为15，展示了很强的走熊态势。</p>
<p>第二部分，70，很强的上升势头</p>
<p>第三部分，34，下跌态势稍微走缓</p>
<p>从RSI指标中能看到的，即使不看RSI的值，我们也能从之前的14根K线猜到。然而使用RSI，我们可以很直观的看到市场的强弱，减少了对K线数据的计算，同时也避免了实时的错误分析。</p>
<h2 id="超卖和超买"><a href="#超卖和超买" class="headerlink" title="超卖和超买"></a>超卖和超买</h2><p>一般来说，当RSI值超过70，表现为市场超买，当RSI低于30，市场表现为超卖。</p>
<p>但是我们回过头来，再看看刚才说过的内容“RSI值越高，阳线涨幅多于阴线跌幅，说明涨势越强”。那么这就显得有些矛盾，所以说，单纯的通过RSI超买超卖来判断“顶底”，是不靠谱的。</p>
<p>从下面的图中可以看到，过去的14根K线中有13根是阴线，而且对应的RSI值是小于30的，RSI呆在了超卖区域很长一段时间。</p>
<p>RSI_oversold<br><img src="http://forex-blog.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/RSI_3.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>RSI的超卖，超买区域，不应该简单的用来判断翻转点位，反而，如果RSI长期处于超卖／超买区域，说明市场正处于很强的下跌／上涨趋势当中。不应该轻易的逆势操作。</p>
<h2 id="利用RSI做突破／反弹"><a href="#利用RSI做突破／反弹" class="headerlink" title="利用RSI做突破／反弹"></a>利用RSI做突破／反弹</h2><p>刚才提到了，通过RSI可以观察到趋势的强弱。通过这个特性，当价格走到支撑阻力位时，我们可以利用RSI这个好助手，来辅助交易。下图展示了EU4小时图，其中1.20位是一个非常坚挺的支撑／阻力位，1.20经历了多次的触碰.</p>
<p>其中，第一次触碰，RSI值分别为63和57，意味着虽然上涨势头很猛，但是背后暗藏的价格动能并不是很强。<br>You can see that price went back to the 1.20 price level several times. During the first time, the RSI showed values of 63 and 57 which meant that although the power was more bullish, it wasn’t a very strong trend behind the price movement. A strong resistance level does usually not break easy and it requires a strong trend to make it past the price.</p>
<p>The second time price went back to the level, the RSI was at 71, indicating a fairly strong bullish trend, the resistance level held again. It wasn’t until the last time when the RSI showed a value of 76 that the resistance level broke and price held above it with the RSI going all the way to currently 85.</p>
<p>RSI_resistance<br><img src="http://forex-blog.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/RSI_4.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>对于使用程序化交易，量化交易的交易者来说，RSI可以提供价格强弱的量化指标，可以帮助交易者从数值角度对市场强弱进行定性比较。</p>
<h2 id="RSI-背离"><a href="#RSI-背离" class="headerlink" title="RSI 背离"></a>RSI 背离</h2><p>最后介绍的RSI使用方法是，通过寻找RSI背离来判断市场价格的拐点。背离信号<br>And, finally, another way of using the RSI to identify turning points is by finding divergences. A divergence signals that what price is showing you, is usually not supported by the underlying price dynamics – we will see what this means now.<br>下图展示了2个<br>The screenshot below shows two lower lows. During the first one, the RSI was at 26 and the price movement leading up to that point included 8 bearish candles, 3 bullish candles, 3 Dojis and price went down 1.45% in total. During the second swing low, the RSI showed a higher RSI of 28 and the price move included 7 bearish candles, 5 bullish candles, 2 Dojis and price lost only 0.96%.</p>
<p>Although price made a new, lower low, the dynamics behind the move weren’t as bearish and the second move wasn’t as strong; the RSI shows that. The second low had a higher RSI (28 vs. 26) although price showed a lower low, thus, signaling that the bears are losing strength. Divergences often fail and we have talked about a more reliant type of divergence here: the double divergence.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Know what price is doing<br>The RSI is a great tool and although you could easily guess what the RSI value by looking at the past 14 candles, plotting the RSI on your charts can add stability and guidance to your trading. If you can quantify price strength and translate it into interpretable numbers, you can make trading decisions more effectively and avoid guesswork and subjective interpretations.</p>

            <p>Most traders struggle because they continuously fight some of the most essential trading principles. At the top of the list is trying to call tops and bottoms and predicting price movements – instead of anticipating price movements. We have talked about the problem of calling tops and bottoms before and today we are exploring a new trading principle which can make a big shift in your trading.</p>
<p>For a lack of better words, we are just going to call this price and trading principle the “Boom and Bust” pattern. I discovered it first several years ago in a book about technical analysis and ever since it has been a big part of my trading. But it is much more than just another price action pattern – it’s an ‘immutable law’ of how traders move the market and how (mass) psychology manifests in price movements.</p>
<p>The introduction to the “Boom and Bust” pattern<br>As the name implies, the pattern consists of two parts: the boom and the bust. The best use for this pattern is when it comes to identifying the end of a trend or if you are looking for a trend reversal opportunity.</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows the ideal “Boom and Bust” pattern. In the initial stage you have a slow and moderate trend (green trendlines). Then, suddenly, the momentum picks up and the trend accelerates until the trendlines have a very steep angle (red trendlines). Afterwards, you usually get some kind of price action pattern (a double top and a failed breakout in this case) or your indicators turn (in the form of divergences, as we will see later) signaling the end of the boom. Finally, the bust happens and price reverses sharply.</p>
<p>This is the ideal scenario and we will now take a look why this pattern works so well.</p>
<p>The characteristics of uptrends and downtrends – the nature of mass psychology<br>It has long been known that price moves very differently during uptrends and downtrends. Whereas, traders treat rallies and sell-offs usually the same, the professionals know that it is necessary to know the current market environment and to adjust their trading approach accordingly – you can’t use the same trading methodology during uptrends and downtrends.</p>
<p>The “Boom and Bust” pattern works best in an uptrend, as described above. The reason is that almost all bubbles start slow and then gain momentum on the way up. Furthermore, the panic after a bubble is greatest after a rally and countless empirical research has confirmed that price movements are much faster during falling markets. Thus, there is less resistance and price travels faster on the way down.</p>
<p>We urge you to start looking at your trading and trading methodology with an open mind. Can you really use your system and trade it both long and short or should there be different rules and methods for buy and sell trades, and for uptrend or downtrend periods?</p>
<p>Measuring the “Boom”<br>To identify a boom period, you don’t necessarily need trendlines. The distance price has traveled away from his moving average can give a first indication of recent price action. Furthermore, Bollinger Bands® can help you measure the degree of over-extendedness of trends and determine how strong the boom-period is. If price has been trading outside of the outer Bollinger Bands and the trend has a lot of momentum (large candles and a high Stochastics value), it often classifies as a boom-scenario.</p>
<p>Tips to trade the “Boom and Bust” pattern<br>The problem with this pattern is that the rallies during Boom-periods can last for a very long time and go much further than logic would suggest. Thus, shorting into theextreme bubbles and Boom-periods has to be avoided! Although, sooner or later every bubble will burst, as a trader you have to find the scenarios where your edge is greatest and stay away from uncertain or unmanageable setups.</p>
<p>Here are the 5 most important trading principles to mastering the “Boom and Bust” pattern:</p>
<p>1) Stay away from the big bubbles!</p>
<p>You can find smaller boom and bust patterns on the lower time-frames – especially the 4H time-frame is a good compromise between the bigger “Boom and Bust” moves on higher time-frames and meaningless and short-lived trends on lower time-frames.</p>
<p>2) Don’t predict. Wait for clear reversal signs</p>
<p>We have said before that trying to predict a market top usually results in a disaster. The professional trader waits for clear reversal signs and only enters a trade once price have started falling already. Just as in trend-following (the term ‘following’ is key!), a trader has to adopt the mindset of reversal-following  – instead of predicting. The first and the last part of a price move is the most difficult to catch and traders do well by trying to focus on getting the ‘safe’ portion in between and not be too greedy.</p>
<p>3) Use confirmation tools</p>
<p>There are many tools a trader can choose from when it comes to identifying slowing momentum and a change in market sentiment. We have talked about divergences,double-divergences and mean reversion trading on Tradeciety before. In addition, price pattern confirmation such as double tops and failed breakouts can also provide important clues. As mentioned before, Bollinger Bands® and moving averages are great tools to measure how strong the boom-period is.</p>
<p>4) Don’t hold too long. “Buying the dip” can often stop prices from falling during a sell-off</p>
<p>The “buying the dip” strategy can be deadly for reversal traders because it often results in short-lived reversals. Trend-following traders who desperately buy dips during a sell-off can eliminate reversal opportunities fast. Thus, be quick to grab profits and know when to get out of your position when it turns on you.</p>
<p>5) Pick your spots!</p>
<p>You have to know what your edge is, especially as a reversal trader. Where do you look for trends that look like a “boom” pattern? How do you define a “boom” scenario? Which tools are you consulting to identify scenarios where a reversal is likely? How do you time entries? How do you choose your targets and when you do exit a trade ahead of target?</p>
<p>Reversal trading can be a lucrative trading style, but, at the same time, it can also end in a disaster very quickly if you are not 100% certain about your edge. Thus, reversal trading should be avoided by amateurs and emotionally unstable traders.</p>

            <p>Consolidations are common and they represent a natural price and market structure; other market structures are trends and reversals. The market can only do one of three things at any given time: trend, consolidate or reverse and if you take a close look you will notice that most of the time, markets are consolidating.</p>
<p> 市场由3种结构组成:单边趋势,反转,震荡.只有这三种情况,所以,只需要判断当前市场的情绪,确定是处于哪种结构,就会对我们的交易有很大帮助.<br>并且,市场大部分时候都处于震荡,即无明显驱动力,价格在一定范围内浮动.</p>
<p>Intro – what is a consolidation?<br>Consolidations happen either during trending market phases or before a new trend. A consolidation is a period of sideways price movement. There are different consolidation patterns as we will see later: sideways ranges or triangle shaped consolidations.</p>
<p>All consolidations represent a period in which markets pause, where indecision about the next price move exist and where traders position themselves for the next move.  Consolidation periods are necessary and trends without proper consolidations often lead to unsustainable price moves.</p>
<p>Further reading: How strong trends turn into a “Boom and Bust” pattern.</p>
<p>Consolidation patterns<br>We distinguish between three consolidation patterns: sideways ranges, downward or upward sloping ranges (also called flags), or triangular consolidations (triangles, wedges and pennants). We will take a brief look at each pattern before exploring how to trade consolidation patterns.</p>
<p> 区间震荡,斜向上/下的区间震荡,三角形震荡等等.先来区分一下,在看看如何交易每种震荡</p>
<p>Ranges<br>A range is defined by highs and lows which can be connected using horizontal lines. Price spends a lot of time ranging and knowing how to trade consolidations can be an important skill for traders.</p>
<p>To shake off amateur traders, you can frequently see false breakouts and breakdowns during horizontal ranges. Typically, volume is low and/or declining during a range and picks up before price makes the real breakout. Fake breakouts to one side can also foreshadow a potential breakout to the opposite side – especially if it is accompanied by rising volume.</p>
<p>A narrowing range signals that markets have “no opinion” and no bias about the next move as price contracts further. In contrast, an expanding range shows increasing volatility and a stronger fight between bulls and bears with more opposing views.</p>
<p>Flags<br>Flags are consolidation patterns that form during trends and they can be found between two trend waves. Whereas amateurs often mistake flag patterns for a reversal, the professionals wait for the successful breakout and the trend continuation.</p>
<p>Flag patterns are typically more reliable when the trend wave prior to the flag has been strong; it makes a trend continuation likely. Again, a trend without proper consolidations often leads to boom-and-bust behavior and then a trend becomes unsustainable.</p>
<p>Pennants and wedges (triangle patterns)<br>The most important factor when analyzing triangle patterns is the sequence of highs and lows and how the trendlines of the upper and lower boundary relate to each other.</p>
<p>We wrote a complete guide on how to trade triangles, which explains all the nuances in depth.</p>
<p>How to trade consolidations<br>When it comes to trading consolidations, there are three concepts traders need to be aware of which make trading more profitable and less risky. The hardest part of trading consolidations is to avoid getting caught in false breakouts. The following three concepts help you identify high probability breakouts during consolidations.</p>
<p>1 – Volume analysis<br>The clues given by volume analysis are typically subtle but they can tell you a lot about what is happening in that consolidation and what is likely to happen next. During a range, volume is usually low and flat. But when price moves towards one end of the consolidation and volume picks up, it can foreshadow a potential breakout.</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows that each time price broke out, or was about to break up, volume showed an uptick. At the same time, whenever we saw a fake or failed breakout, volume was either low or declining.</p>
<p>2 – The length and width of the consolidation<br>A consolidation is often referred to as a pot where the pressure slowly builds up while somebody is holding down the lit. The longer a consolidation period and the narrower the boundaries of the consolidation, the stronger the subsequent breakout.</p>
<p>However, the longer the range, the more traders will start paying attention to it and; long ranges will often have more false breakouts as the professionals try to shake off the amateurs. During long ranges, waiting for a confirmed breakout and not entering prematurely – predicting a breakout – is the key to successful trading.</p>
<p>3 – Always wait for the retest back safer<br>Whereas volume analysis is helpful for stocks traders, the principle of retest-confirmation is especially valuable for Forex trading. Equities often show a runaway behavior after a breakout, but currencies often come back to the origin of the consolidation and “retest” the consolidation boundaries.</p>
<p>The USD/JPY chart below shows a lot of large consolidation areas and each time price broke out of such an area, it came back to retest the upper or lower boundary of that range. Thus, a trader can either choose to trade the initial breakout – and run into false breakouts frequently – or wait for the retest while fighting the urge to trade and chase the initial breakout. There is no “better” or “worse” – it comes down to personal preferences of the trader and which style feels more natural to him.</p>
<p>Further reading: Trading supply and demand zones</p>
<p>Conclusion<br>Consolidations happen frequently and they are a natural and necessary market structure during long periods of trends or before the existence of a new trend. Volume analysis, the length and width of the consolidation, shaking off amateur traders before breakouts, or failed breakout are all clues which help the attentive trader to connect the dots and enable him to make sophisticated decisions about the sentiment within that range.</p>

            <p>一个成功的交易者,需要正确的止损,而且还要正确的理解止损的内在含义.对止损单背后逻辑的错误理解,会对交易者产生灾难性的影响.亏损后的报复性交易和手动的将止损扩大,是对止损错误理解产生的2个错误操作.类似错误都会导致”过大”的亏损,所以有必要研究止损逻辑,明确止损的本质.</p>
<h1 id="止损的含义"><a href="#止损的含义" class="headerlink" title="止损的含义"></a>止损的含义</h1><p>止损,应该被放在一个价位,这个价位是你的预期失效的地方,即当走到了这个位置时,与入场理论完全相悖.那么说明的当初入场是的判断完全错误了,你需要退出交易,重新思考局势.这就是止损背后的唯一含义.</p>
<p>然而,大多数新手的错误操作是,看到一个交易机会,下单, 设置YY的止盈位.最后根据自己”系统”的R:R比,设置一个止损位置,或者是在一个关键RS位设置(这时会发现R:R非常小,甚至小于1).这样做就是没有全面考虑止损,或者说没有在理解止损后作出错误单.</p>
<p><strong>止损的位置，应该是使你入场理由相悖的地方，而不是单纯的满足R：R</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://forex-blog.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/%E9%94%99%E8%AF%AF%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%AD%A2%E6%8D%9F.png" alt="&quot;错误的流程&quot;"><br>错误使用止损方法</p>
<p><img src="http://forex-blog.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/%E6%AD%A3%E7%A1%AE%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%AD%A2%E6%8D%9F.png" alt="&quot;正确的流程&quot;"><br>正确使用止损流程</p>
<h1 id="正确使用止损的范例"><a href="#正确使用止损的范例" class="headerlink" title="正确使用止损的范例"></a>正确使用止损的范例</h1><p>每个交易者都会有自己的入场条件和交易计划。当价格走到了某个位置，与你的期望的形态不同时，那就说明你错了，那么这个位置就是你应该设定止损的位置。比如说，现在价格下跌到了底部，并且走出了W底的形态，你打算底部反弹做多。在下单前，需要计算好的就是，当价格下降到W下面多少时，W底形态被破坏，这就是你止损的地方。</p>
<p>下面的图说的就是类似情况，绿色区域是可以忍受的价格波动。如果进入了黄色区域，说明价格离前期低点太远，当初你做多的假设（前期低点，反弹）错误了。那么就需要止损了。</p>
<p><img src="http://forex-blog.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/sl1.png" alt="&quot;&quot;"></p>
<h1 id="没人在乎你的入场位置"><a href="#没人在乎你的入场位置" class="headerlink" title="没人在乎你的入场位置"></a>没人在乎你的入场位置</h1><p>当交易者高估了自己的入场点位，或者交易者害怕一单的亏损时，他们会期望价格向他们所预期的方向反转。抱着这种想法，慢慢的，一种盼望，寄予期望等情绪会蔓延在交易者身上，这会使交易者完完全全忘掉，最初他们做这笔交易的原因。大脑里都是对走势的乞求，或者抱怨，失去了理智的判断，交易系统也完全放到一边了。</p>
<p>如果你原来打算在前期低点做多，尝试反弹入场。那么你一定别忘了你当初的计划。如果价格没有反弹，与你的预期差太多，说明这个前期低点支撑力度不够，市场已经突破了这个支撑。此时，止损出场，重新审视市场走势，学习这次失败的原因，体会市场情绪，反思一下，才是明智之举。</p>
<h1 id="扩大止损范围意味着什么"><a href="#扩大止损范围意味着什么" class="headerlink" title="扩大止损范围意味着什么"></a>扩大止损范围意味着什么</h1><p>当价格反向波动时，交易者常犯的错误是，担心被打止损，导致手动的扩大止损范围。不但你现在亏损在增多，也导致你需要更多的正向波动，才会盈利（has to move much further in order to make any money）。</p>
<p>下面的截图说明了这个道理。<br>此次交易的初衷是在前期的支撑位做多，反弹到区间高点后获利出局。最初的止损位1，表明了价格跌到这里，说明了支撑位失效，价格不会反弹，退出交易。<br>然而，当价格突破支撑位时，交易者放宽了止损到达2位置。那么，损失和盈利比就会放大，从这点上看，就是一笔错误的交易。而且，入场时认为支撑位有效，那么趋势是做多，或者是区间，但是价格突破了SL1来到了SL2，当前的形势就完全变化了。这与当初出场的理由完全背离。</p>
<p>所以，当价格逼近你的止损位置是，心理不要一直盼望着价格会反转，不要心存侥幸，希望扩大一点止损，价格就会往你想的方向反转。而是应该将时间定格，重新审视市场的走势，为什么没有按照你入场的想法走，重新分析市场情绪。<br><strong>这就是所谓的不要尝试战胜市场，要顺应市场，迎合市场的走势，及时变化策略</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://forex-blog.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/sl2.png" alt="&quot;点击放大&quot;"></p>
<p>如果看了上面的分析，你还是不能理性的交易，那再次扩大止损前，问自己一个问题：<br>如果你没有当前这笔交易，你会在你的止损位以同方向入场吗？</p>
<p>如果你的回答是NO，那么最好关闭当前交易，重新审视市场走势。俗话说，当局者迷，因为你的利益在其中损失或缩小盈利，所以你会被当前市场走势所迷惑心智。那么最好的方法是，先出来，看看再说。</p>

            <h1 id="为什么交易"><a href="#为什么交易" class="headerlink" title="为什么交易"></a>为什么交易</h1><p>大部分人为了赚钱才开始交易，无论是外汇市场，商品期货市场，股票市场等等。<br>也有人是为了挑战自己，挑战市场，也会进入市场。<br>但是不管你进入市场的原因是什么，最终目的都是赚钱。在这里赚钱就是成功，不论出身，不论方法。</p>
<h1 id="为什么失败"><a href="#为什么失败" class="headerlink" title="为什么失败"></a>为什么失败</h1><p>首先在投机市场交易中失败的人群，我觉得可以分为两类。<br>第一类，怀着暴利的梦想进来，但是一直在亏钱，尝试了各种方法圣杯后，还是亏钱。有可能在几个月之间，开始的梦想破灭了，觉得赚钱是不可能的。找了很多借口，比如大家常听到的，“如果你能赚钱，那么多专业机构还吃什么”，“这个市场只有1%非常有天赋的人才能赚钱”，“这个市场都是骗人的，都是被大户操纵的，一般人赚不到钱”等等。相信这些说辞，就放弃了。<br>第二类，在市场中，苦苦挣扎，对于各种指标方法，都会尝试，但是浅尝辄止，跟小时候学的挖井人一样。拿来一种别人成功的系统，开始研究，在市场上尝试，但是过了几个月，发现根本没办法一个月翻几倍，还是老亏钱。就立马再找其他系统，在论坛，讨论群里寻找各种牛人的各种指标，不停的尝试。他们看起来什么都懂，非常热衷于学习，尝试。偶尔会回测到很漂亮的曲线。但是总体来说还是没办法稳定盈利。<br>这两种失败的交易者，是最常见的。从他们身上，可以悟到一些交易的哲学。<br>市场是万变的，但是每个交易者都有自己的交易信仰。忠于自己的交易哲学，忠于自己的理念，相信自己的交易系统，不停的完善，那么肯定能熬过一个交易者最黑暗的时期。<br>把镜头拉远，回想一下我们的人生，我们生活的社会。现在社会中的人非常浮躁，做一件事恨不得马上成功，明天就能暴富。为了成功不择手段，不要提信仰，连最基本的道德底线都没有。所以，在交易这条道路上，我们要一步一个脚印，从基本做起，摆正态度（把交易当作一个事业）。</p>
<h1 id="为什么需要信仰"><a href="#为什么需要信仰" class="headerlink" title="为什么需要信仰"></a>为什么需要信仰</h1><p>这里的信仰和大家心中的宗教信仰，有相似之处，也有区别的地方。</p>
